### Premise

The premise of this challenge is to create a "profile page" for various star wars characters in the Star Wars universe.

### Specification

Create a simple single page application that provides the following features:

- A search bar that takes the characters name as input.
- A profile containing the following sectional information for the searched character:
  - About Me (height, weight, hair color, date of birth, species information)
  - Films Appeared In
  - Starships Flown

Use [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) to obtain all the star wars data that you need.

Use whatever languages or tech you want -- we are looking for clean, testable code that demonstrates usage of common design patterns and best practices above all else.

#### BUT

You will get bonus points if...

- A decent understanding of React is demonstrated
- A decent understanding of Next.js is demonstrated
- A decent understanding of unit/integration testing is demonstrated
- A basic "gateway" api is created to consolidate and proxy calls to SWAPI
- You add cool and creative features not included in the spec
